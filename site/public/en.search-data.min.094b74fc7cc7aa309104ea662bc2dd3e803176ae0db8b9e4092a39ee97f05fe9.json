I am a seasoned C++ developer\u0026hellip;\nAbout AlgoMetix # Who Am I? # Welcome to AlgoMetix! I am a seasoned C++ developer with over 20 years of experience in low-latency and algorithmic trading platforms. Having worked in front-office trading desks at leading investment banks like Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, I have deep expertise in designing and optimizing real-world trading systems. My focus has always been on performance, efficiency, and robustness—critical aspects of any high-performance computing application.\nWhat is AlgoMetix? # AlgoMetix is inspired by the Sanskrit word Tattvartha, meaning \u0026ldquo;true essence of things.\u0026rdquo; This aligns with the website’s goal of exploring the fundamental principles behind high-performance computing, advanced C++ techniques, and real-world optimizations. The name reflects the focus on deep, practical insights rather than surface-level knowledge.\nWhat This Website Offers # This website is a place where I share my knowledge and experience in advanced C++ programming, low-latency system design, performance optimization, and real-world algorithmic trading architectures. My articles go beyond the standard programming books, covering:\nAdvanced C++ Techniques – Templates, memory management, multi-threading, lock-free data structures, and more. Low-Latency Optimization – CPU cache efficiency, false sharing, NUMA-aware programming, and compiler optimizations. Algorithmic Trading System Design – Order execution, market data handling, risk management, and connectivity with exchanges. Efficient and Optimized Code – Practical solutions that work in real-world production environments. Under-the-Hood Insights – How compilers, memory models, and CPU architectures impact software performance. Why AlgoMetix? # The internet is full of beginner-friendly programming tutorials, but real-world high-performance and low-latency system design is rarely covered in depth. My goal is to fill that gap by providing practical, production-grade insights that are immediately useful for professionals working in trading, high-performance computing, and systems programming.\nConsulting Services # With my extensive industry experience, I am also available for consulting on:\nPerformance tuning of existing C++ codebases. Designing and optimizing low-latency trading systems. Architecting scalable, high-performance applications. Code reviews, mentoring, and training teams on advanced C++ topics. Get in Touch # If you are interested in consulting, collaborations, or have any questions, feel free to contact me at ppatoria.jp@gmail.com.
