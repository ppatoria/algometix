Reordering issues occurs in single-core machines with multiple threads. It's a common misconception that multi-core systems are a prerequisite for reordering problems. While the *consequences* of reordering might be more dramatic in multi-core systems (due to cache coherence complexities), the *root cause* – compiler and CPU optimizations – exists even in single-core environments.

**How Reordering Occurs in a Single-Core System:**

Even though there's only one core executing instructions, the compiler and the CPU can still reorder memory operations. Here's why:

1.  **Compiler Optimizations:** As discussed earlier, the compiler can reorder instructions during compilation to improve instruction-level parallelism or reduce register dependencies. These reorderings are generally safe from the perspective of a single-threaded program, but they can introduce subtle problems in a multi-threaded context.
2.  **CPU Optimizations (Out-of-Order Execution):** Modern CPUs often employ out-of-order execution techniques to maximize performance. Even on a single core, the CPU might reorder memory operations as long as it doesn't violate data dependencies within a single thread's execution.
3.  **Context Switching and Time Slicing:** In a single-core system, multiple threads share the CPU's time through context switching. The operating system rapidly switches between threads, giving each thread a small time slice to execute. This context switching introduces interleaving of instructions from different threads, which can expose reordering issues.

**Scenarios Where Reordering Matters in a Single-Core, Multi-Threaded Environment:**

1.  **Producer-Consumer Patterns:** As we've discussed at length, if a producer writes data and then sets a flag, a consumer might see the flag before the data update propagates, even if both threads are running on the same core.
2.  **Locking and Synchronization:**
    *   Improper lock implementations: If you're using a broken or poorly designed lock implementation, reordering can cause multiple threads to enter a critical section simultaneously, even on a single core.
    *   Memory barriers are omitted: If you forget to use memory barriers, the compiler or CPU can reorder memory operations related to lock acquisition or release, leading to race conditions.
3.  **Initialization of Shared Data Structures:** If one thread initializes a shared data structure and then signals to another thread that the initialization is complete, reordering can cause the second thread to access the data structure before it is fully initialized.
4.  **Double-Checked Locking:** This is a classic example where reordering can lead to problems. The intent is to avoid acquiring a lock if it's not necessary. However, without proper memory barriers, reordering can cause a thread to see that the shared resource is initialized but then access an uninitialized or partially initialized object.
5.  **Signal Handlers:** Although less common, reordering can also affect signal handlers. If a signal handler modifies shared data, reordering can lead to unexpected behavior if the main thread and the signal handler are not properly synchronized.

**Important Note:** The likelihood and severity of reordering issues can vary depending on the specific compiler, CPU architecture, and operating system. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential for reordering and to use appropriate synchronization techniques to prevent it.

**Key Takeaway:** Reordering is not solely a multi-core problem. Even in single-core systems, compiler and CPU optimizations can reorder memory operations, leading to subtle but potentially significant issues in multi-threaded programs. The correct use of memory barriers and synchronization primitives is essential to prevent these issues.
