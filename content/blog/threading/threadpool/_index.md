There are multiple ways to design a thread pool, each with different trade-offs in terms of efficiency, complexity, and flexibility. Here are some common design patterns:

---

### **1. Basic Thread Pool (Mutex + Condition Variable) [Your Current Model]**
   - **Threads:** Fixed-size array of worker threads.
   - **Task Queue:** A queue protected by a mutex.
   - **Synchronization:** Workers use a condition variable to wait when the queue is empty.
   - **Pros:** Simple, easy to implement.
   - **Cons:** Potential bottlenecks due to mutex contention.

---

### **2. Lock-Free Thread Pool**
   - **Threads:** Fixed-size pool of worker threads.
   - **Task Queue:** Lock-free data structures (e.g., a lock-free queue or ring buffer).
   - **Synchronization:** Atomic operations and memory fences instead of mutexes.
   - **Pros:** Reduces contention, improves performance in high-contention scenarios.
   - **Cons:** More complex, requires careful use of atomic operations.

---

### **3. Work-Stealing Thread Pool (Used in oneTBB, Java Fork/Join)**
   - **Threads:** Each worker has its own task queue.
   - **Task Queue:** Local queues per worker + optional global queue.
   - **Synchronization:** Workers try to execute tasks from their queue; if empty, they steal from others.
   - **Pros:** Improved load balancing, reduces contention on a single queue.
   - **Cons:** Slightly complex, may require fine-tuning to prevent excessive stealing.

---

### **4. Thread-per-Core Pool**
   - **Threads:** Fixed to the number of hardware threads.
   - **Task Queue:** Per-thread task queues, often with an event loop.
   - **Synchronization:** Minimal (since each thread processes its own queue).
   - **Pros:** Low overhead, avoids excessive context switching.
   - **Cons:** Might not be flexible for varying workloads.

---

### **5. Fiber-Based Thread Pool**
   - **Threads:** A small pool of worker threads.
   - **Task Queue:** Tasks are lightweight fibers/coroutines scheduled across threads.
   - **Synchronization:** User-space scheduling, cooperative multitasking.
   - **Pros:** Low overhead compared to OS threads, can handle millions of tasks.
   - **Cons:** Requires coroutine-based execution model.

---

### **6. Hybrid Thread Pool (Thread + Task Decomposition)**
   - **Threads:** Mix of long-running worker threads and short-lived task threads.
   - **Task Queue:** Separate queues for different types of tasks (e.g., CPU-bound, I/O-bound).
   - **Synchronization:** Conditional variables or lock-free queues.
   - **Pros:** Handles heterogeneous workloads better.
   - **Cons:** More complex scheduling logic.

---

### **7. Thread Pool with Prioritization**
   - **Threads:** A fixed-size pool of worker threads.
   - **Task Queue:** Priority queue instead of FIFO.
   - **Synchronization:** Mutex or lock-free priority queue.
   - **Pros:** Useful for real-time or latency-sensitive tasks.
   - **Cons:** Priority inversion can be a challenge.

---

### **8. Dynamic Thread Pool**
   - **Threads:** Pool expands and shrinks based on demand.
   - **Task Queue:** Shared queue.
   - **Synchronization:** Mutex and condition variable.
   - **Pros:** More flexible, better resource utilization.
   - **Cons:** Thread creation/destruction overhead.

---

### **9. Thread Pool with Promises and Futures**
   - **Threads:** A fixed-size pool of worker threads.
   - **Task Submission:** Instead of a direct function execution, tasks return a `std::future<T>` associated with a `std::promise<T>`.
   - **Task Queue:** A queue of callable functions, each wrapping a `std::promise`.
   - **Synchronization:** The main thread retrieves the future and waits for completion asynchronously.
